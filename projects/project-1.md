This project was for the class ICS 212. It was a basic implementation of a record system with an interactive menu the user could interact with. There were 6 different options for the record. These options are add record, print record, print all record, delete record, read file, write file, clean up, and modify record.

For the add record, it allowed the user to add a record which included their name, address, and account number. The recorded needed to be added in a correct order, in order to do this the account number was compared. The delete record deleted the record of the account number the user inputed. Print record basically printed the record based on the account number the user entered. Read basically read a file into a text array. Write basically wrote the data into a text file. Each of the functions or options were implemented using C++. 

This was a solo project, so I was the main programmer. I implemented each of the functions using pointers. Personally, from this project I learned how to used pointers to access data from a different function. I learned how to problem solve and create code without multiple return statements in one function and without breaks. I learned how to sketch out my ideas of the movement of memory in a program. 

I plan to revist this project to add more features. I plan to add a more interactive menu with more advanced features.
