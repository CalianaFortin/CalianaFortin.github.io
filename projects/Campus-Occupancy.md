The idea for this project came from the HACC 2020 challenge. My HACC team consisted of <a href="https://fredstraub.github.io"> Fred Straub </a> and <a href="https://buccatm.github.io/"> Marcos Buccat </a>. We chose to tackle the campus visualization issue. However, due to time constraints we were unable to finish the project in time for the competion despite this we decided to push on and use this as our final project.

## Features
The Campus Occupany application features a landing page which allows the user to see a map of the UH campus and the occupancy of people in each of the buildings. A legend is provided at the bottom of the map to help the user decipher which of the buildings are most occupied. Green buildings are less occupied and red building are very occupied. Not only is the user able to see this visualization, but they are also able to the visualtions of other dates and times. Simply just click in the drop down menu and select the date/time you would like to view.
