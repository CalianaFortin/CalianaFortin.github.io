## What are Coding Standards?
Coding Standards are basically a set of coding rules, guidelines, and best practices. An example of coding standards is the indentation of code or the way variables are named.

## Why are Coding Standards Important?
Coding standards are used to help to improve the overall appearance and readability of code. This is especially important when working with a team or group. It ensures a uniformity regardless of who wrote the code. "Coding Standards" also help to detect basic coding mistakes (e.g. Syntactic errors), such as using a variable before it is declared.

## How are Coding standards enforced?
Coding standards are usually enforced using automation. These tools are are run regularly to fix these errors. An example of a tool is Lint. Lint was used to check passive errors and such. The one used for Javascript is EsLint. These tools can be configured to fit a certain coding standard that you specify.

## My View of Coding Standards
I believe that Coding Standards help to improve the overall quality of code. If something is difficult to read, it is harder to improve, therefore the quality of the code is inadequate. I feel that enforcing coding standards helps to improve the process of learning a new programing language. Since coding standards make code more readable, it makes it easier to understand, therefore making it easier to learn.

## My Experience with IntelliJ and EsLint
Personally for me I like using IntelliJ and EsLint. IntelliJ is very customizable and provides many different options. EsLint helps me keep my code looking nice. It helps to indent the code and make my code more readable, so that I can spot logical errors in my code. It also makes it easier for other people to help me when I have a problem with my code.

The only con about EsLint is that I have to always install it before I start a new project. I personally think it would be better if EsLint could be automated and preinstalled for each project.

Other than that I really enjoy using IntelliJ and EsLint.
