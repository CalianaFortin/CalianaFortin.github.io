##Learning HTML and CSS:
Personally, I have never learned how to make my own website. This was the first time I was learning HTML and CSS. At first it was difficult, I did not undestand how to make a header or how to utilize a div container. I did not know how to change the font or change the background color. However, after spending a few days learning the ins and outs of HTML and CSS, I felt more comfortable with making a basic website. The website I made was really basic, and quite frankly ugly. It was hard to get an image to the exact place I wanted it to be. I had to manually change the amount of pixels to make something look better. After messing around with HTML and CSS, I wondered how could I make a more modern website, like the ones I visit every day.

##Semantic UI 
After learning the basics of HTML and CSS, we learned about semantic UI. To me personally semantic UI is very intuitive, and easy to use. You simply look up the type of element you want, paste the code into your IDE and then edit it to your liking. It was not too much different from just using CSS and HTML. The major difference between just using HTML and CSS, is that semantic UI is way more modern and better looking than just vanilla HTML and CSS. The design of each of the elements such as the menu or search bar are so much nicer. After learning a little bit of semantic UI, I can understand better about how modern websites are designed. The only major negative about using semantic ui as opposed to just HTML and CSS is that it is not very customizable. Countless number of times I would want to create a specifc style that I was not able to recreate using semantic ui. It is often difficult to edit certain elements from semantic UI, so sometimes I would just spend hours trying to inspect the element, and edit it from their only for it to not work. 

##My Perspective of Semantic UI
After using Semantic UI for a little bit, I can say that it's okay. Its really cool that a beginner of web design can create cool and modern websites, however somethimes semantic UI gets in the way of my creativity. Sometimes I want something to look a certain way and Semantic ui makes it difficult to try and do more creative things. I think that semantic UI is greate for beginners, it gives me the tools I need to make a decent website with working features. I think its good to learn about different UI frameworks because it provides you with a way to make a modern website without all the hassel. Although, semantic UI is not as flexible as I would like it to be, it enables me to search for another UI framework that is more suited for me. I am eager to discover more frameworks that give me the flexibility to do what I want. 

##Website Design and Software Engineering
I think that learning webstie design is crucial for a software engineer. Its important to visually show people your skills, and websites enable software engineers to display their work visually. I think that learning basic web design enables software engineers to create their own personalized website to display their personality and their technical skill. 

##My Persepective of Web design
Although I am only a beginner learning the basics of web design I can say that I have gained more apreciation of the visually stunning websites that I visit. It is honestly an art form to make a nice looking website with cool features. It takes a lot of effor to make something really beautiful to look at, so to me web design it definitely an art form that takes years to master.
