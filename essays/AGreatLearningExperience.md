## The Team

Working in a group is always a great learning experience. You learn how to work with different people and different dynamics. It was my first time working in a large group completely online. The name of our team was Shocking Development and the group consisted of eight members Shin Saito, Matthew Kirts, Kyra Ikeda, Christian Jensen, Trey Sumida, Ted Galway-Severtson, and Jerome Gallego.

Personally, I have never learned how to make my own website. This was the first time I was learning HTML and CSS. At first, it was difficult, I did not undestand how to make a header or how to utilize a div container. I did not know how to change the font or change the background color. However, after spending a few days learning the ins and outs of HTML and CSS, I felt more comfortable making a basic website. The website I made was really basic, and quite frankly ugly. It was hard to get an image to the exact place I wanted it to be. I had to manually change the amount of pixels to make something look better. After messing around with HTML and CSS, I wondered how could I make a more modern website, like the ones I visit every day.

## The Goal
We were given the prompt of making a web application for HEI, specifically our client was Creighton Liu from HEI. Creighton wanted us to make a GHG tracker that showed the user savings based on their choice of transportation. The prompt was very much an open concept, we had creative control of the design of the UI, and with our goal out of the way we started on the mockups for the website. 

## My Perspective of Semantic UI

After using Semantic UI for a bit, I can say that it's okay. Its really cool that a beginner of web design can create cool and modern websites, however somethimes semantic UI gets in the way of my creativity. Sometimes I want something to look a certain way and Semantic ui makes it difficult to try to do more creative things. I think that semantic UI is greate for beginners, it gives me the tools I need to make a decent website with working features. I think its good to learn about different UI frameworks because it provides you with a way to make a modern website without all the hassel. Although, semantic UI is not as flexible as I would like it to be, it enables me to search for another UI framework that is more suited for me. I am eager to discover more frameworks that give me the flexibility to do what I want. 

## Website Design and Software Engineering

I think that learning webstie design is crucial for a software engineer. It's important to visually show people your skills, and websites enable software engineers to display their work visually. I think that learning basic web design enables software engineers to create their own personalized website to display their personality and their technical skill. 

## My Persepective of Web design

Although I am only a beginner learning the basics of web design I can say that I have gained more apreciation of the visually stunning websites that I visit. It takes a lot of effort to make something really beautiful to look at, so to me web design truly is an art form that takes time to master.
