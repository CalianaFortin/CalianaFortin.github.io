## The Team
Working in a group is always a great learning experience. You learn how to work with different people and different dynamics. It was my first time working in a large group completely online. The name of our team was Shocking Development and the group consisted of eight members Shin Saito, Matthew Kirts, Kyra Ikeda, Christian Jensen, Trey Sumida, Ted Galway-Severtson, and Jerome Gallego.
