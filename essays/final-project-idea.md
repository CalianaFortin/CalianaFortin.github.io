Project HACC: University of Hawaii â€“ Visualizing Campus Occupancy Trends During (AND After) COVID-19 challenge from the Hawaiian Annual Code Challenge 
 
## Overview
## Problem:
The challenge is to develop a way for the college to visualize occupancy of the campus.  The three current purposes are to assist in scheduling on the campus, assess social distancing and group density, and help with long term facility planning.  The application is intended for the university administration. The data available is anonymized to protect the identities of the visitors to the campus. 
 
## Solution: 
The current map that the university uses [http://www.hawaii.edu/wireless/map/] is for the outdoor areas.  The goal is to have a map that can also show indoor grouping of visitors.  
 
## Mockup page Ideas:
Implement visualizations with the D3 JavaScript library. 
Will have a landing page, thats will ask for admin to login
Admin page displays the visualizations occupancy of the campus

## Case Ideas:
The landing page will display the login. After logging in as an admin, the page is directed to the admin page. In this page it will display the visualized occupancy of the campus. There will be options for the admin user such as to edit or add data.
 
## Beyond the Basic:
This application could be used to dispatch the campus security to monitor behavior if real-time data is used.  It could also be used to direct cleaning crews on areas that need extra attention at the end of the day.  The information collected on actual human traffic behavior, could be used to evaluate current emergency policies that the campus has in place including evacuation plans. 
Possible additional uses for this application include it being used as a framework for other facilities (schools, malls, public facilities) to monitor human traffic and group sizes.  Additionally it would be beneficial to have the application be rendered in a three dimensional view, so that multi-level facilities can see exactly where the groups are.
