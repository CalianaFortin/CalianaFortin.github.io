Questions are an *integral* part to learning and understanding a subject. Today, online forums such as Stack-Overflow are used to ask questions regarding programing. A user will usually post a question regarding a problem they have. However, not all questions are treated equally... 


## What is a smart question?

Not all questions are treated equally. A question like  "Where can I find a good IDE?", will often receive replies like "Google it yourself". This is a not so smart question. The person responding to the question believes the asker didn't do the research themselves. Overall it makes the asker seem lazy. This not so smart question can be made into a smart question. Rather the asker should have typed "I have googled for some good IDE's, but I am not sure which one to pick X or Y. Any suggestions for the one I should choose." This questions tells the responders that the asker did their research, it also gives the responder some extra insight about what to answer and also how to answer.

## Why are smart questions important?

By asking a smart question, you can get a more concise answer. A vague question may not get answered at all. A lazy question will recieve obvious answer such as "Google it yourself". By asking a smart question you can avoid the embarrassment, and get the answer you were looking for.
