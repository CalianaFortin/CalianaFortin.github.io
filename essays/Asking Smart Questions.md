Questions are an *integral* part to learning and understanding a subject. Today, online forums such as Stack-Overflow are used to ask questions regarding programing. A user will usually post a question regarding a problem they have. However, not all questions are treated equally... 


## What is a smart question?

Not all questions are treated equally. A question like  "Where can I find a good IDE?", will often receive replies like "Google it yourself". This is a not so smart question. The person responding to the question believes the asker didn't do the research themselves. Overall it makes the asker seem lazy. This not so smart question can be made into a smart question.
