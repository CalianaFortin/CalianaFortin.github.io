Questions are an *integral* part to learning and understanding a subject. Today, online forums such as Stack-Overflow are used to ask questions regarding programing. A user will usually post a question regarding a problem they have. However, not all questions are treated equally... 


## What is a smart question?

Not all questions are treated equally. A question like  "Where can I find a good IDE?", will often receive replies like "Google it yourself". This is a not so smart question. The person responding to the question believes the asker didn't do the research themselves. Overall it makes the asker seem lazy. This not so smart question can be made into a smart question. Rather the asker should have typed "I have googled for some good IDE's, but I am not sure which one to pick X or Y. Any suggestions for the one I should choose." This questions tells the responders that the asker did their research, it also gives the responder some extra insight about what to answer and also how to answer.

## Why are smart questions important?

By asking a smart question, you can get a more concise answer. A vague question may not get answered at all. A lazy question will recieve obvious answer such as "Google it yourself". By asking a smart question you can avoid the embarrassment, and get the answer you were looking for. 

## Example of a smart question:


<img class="ui centered medium image" src="../images/Smart question example.png"> 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4244896/dynamically-access-object-property-using-variable">A Smart Question</a>

In this example a smart question asked will usually start off with a good title. The title in the example tells the responder that the asker is looking for an answer concerning, "Dynamically access object property using variable". An example of a bad title is something like this, "HELP, I need help with this!". This title may seem whiny or annoying to the responder. It also doesn't let the responder know what they are answering.  

The next thing a smart question will have is a description or summary of what *precisely* you need help with. In this example, the asker states the following "I'm trying to access a property of an object using a dynamic name. Is this possible?". This tells the responder what the user is trying to do, and what they want to know. From this description we exactly know what the asker needs help with. 

The last thing a smart question has is evidence or examples. In this example the asker typed out some example code of what he is referring to when asking for help. By providing example code the responder will be able to precisely tell you what you are asking and if you have any errors in your code. 

In the response section to this question we can see that the user got a concise answer with examples.

## Example of a not so smart question


<img class="ui centered medium image" src="../images/Bad question.png"> 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51580918/could-someone-explain-me-what-this-mean-line-by-line">A not so smart question</a>

In this example a not so smart question is asked. The first thing to notice is that the title of the question is not informative,grammatically correct, and its asking for someone to do their work. This title is not informative. It does not tell the responder what part of the code they need help understanding. The title also has a grammatical error in it. A grammatical error often will tell the responder that the question your asking is last minute, and that you did not try to proofread the question before asking. Lastly, the title is telling the responder to do something for them instead of asking for help.

The next thing to notice is that the description is not very descriptive. It does not precisely summarize what the asker wants help with. The description also includes that the question they are asking is their homework. This can make the asker seem lazy because they do not want to attempt their homework themselves. 

The only good thing about this question is that they provide an example or evidence. In this question they typed the code they needed help with which helped to give context.
