Questions are an *integral* part to learning and understanding a subject. Today, online forums such as Stack-Overflow are used to ask questions regarding programing. A user will usually post a question regarding a problem they have. However, not all questions are treated equally... 


## What is a smart question?

A smart question is a question that is concise, while still providing enought detail and an example to help the responder answer adequately.

An example of a smart question is  "I have googled for some good IDE's, but I am not sure which one to pick X or Y. Any suggestions for the one I should choose." This questions tells the responders that the asker did their research, it also gives the responder some extra insight about what to answer and also how to answer.

## What is a not so smart question?

A not so smart question is often like this, "Where can I find a good IDE?". This will most likely receive replies like "Google it yourself". The person responding to the question believes the asker didn't do the research themselves. Overall it makes the asker seem lazy. 

## Why are smart questions important?

By asking a smart question, you can get a more concise answer. A vague question may not get answered at all. A lazy question will recieve obvious answer such as "Google it yourself". By asking a smart question you can avoid the embarrassment, and get the answer you were looking for. 

## Example of a smart question:


<img class="ui left medium image" src="../images/Smart question example.png"> 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4244896/dynamically-access-object-property-using-variable">A Link to a Smart Question</a>

In this example a smart question asked will usually start off with a good title. The title in the example tells the responder that the asker is looking for an answer concerning, "Dynamically access object property using variable". An example of a bad title is something like this, "HELP, I need help with this!". This title may seem whiny or annoying to the responder. It also doesn't let the responder know what they are answering.  

The next thing a smart question will have is a description or summary of what *precisely* you need help with. In this example, the asker states the following "I'm trying to access a property of an object using a dynamic name. Is this possible?". This tells the responder what the user is trying to do, and what they want to know. From this description we exactly know what the asker needs help with. 

The last thing a smart question has is evidence or examples. In this example the asker typed out some example code of what he is referring to when asking for help. By providing example code the responder will be able to precisely tell you what you are asking and if you have any errors in your code. 

In the response section to this question we can see that the user got a concise answer with examples.

## Example of a not so smart question:


<img class="ui left medium image" src="../images/Bad question.png"> 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51580918/could-someone-explain-me-what-this-mean-line-by-line">A Link to a Not So Smart Question</a>

In this example a not so smart question is asked. The first thing to notice is that the title of the question is not informative,grammatically correct, and its asking for someone to do their work. This title is not informative. It does not tell the responder what part of the code they need help understanding. The title also has a grammatical error in it. A grammatical error often will tell the responder that the question your asking is last minute, and that you did not try to proofread the question before asking. Lastly, the title is telling the responder to do something for them instead of asking for help.

The next thing to notice is that the description is not very descriptive. It does not precisely summarize what the asker wants help with. The description also includes that the question they are asking is their homework. This can make the asker seem lazy because they do not want to attempt their homework themselves. 

The only good thing about this question is that they provide an example or evidence. In this question they typed the code they needed help with which helped to give context. 

## How do smart questions relate to Software Engineers?

A smart Software Engineer needs to know how to ask smart questions. "Why?" well when trying to develop software with a deadline time is something that cannot be wasted. A not so smart question will waste time thus make getting an answer difficult. A smart question will often get a answer quick thus not wasting crucial time.  

## Insights I gained from reading *"How to ask questions the smart way" by Eric Raymond*

From this reading, I learned how to ask smart questions to get good answers. With this new insight I will be able to ask smart questions not only in my computer science classes but in my other classes too. I feel that smart questions not only apply to the technical field but to other things too. Given the new environment COVID has put a lot of people in, smart questions will be even more useful. With everything currently being online, I think it makes it more difficult for most people to interact and have good discussions. It is often hard for me to get help from my professors without physically being their to show them what I need help with. However, by learning about smart questions it helped me to overcome this obstacle.
