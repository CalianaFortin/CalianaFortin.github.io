Going through an academic journey is often difficult. Many times there will be moments when you want to give up. I know that personally I have been through these moments. Often when things would get hard I would question myself *"Am I good enough?"*. Am I good enough to keep going on ... should I try something easier? These are the kind of things I would ponder to myself when going through my computer science journey.

## My Journey with Computers

Ever since I was younger I always was fascinated with technology. I would spend hours on end trying to understand how a video game worked or how a computer worked. My dad was a website developer and I used to ask him a countless number of questions about programming. Eventually at the age of 11, my mother and my father decided to teach me how to code. My dad had me sign up for code academy and learn ruby on rails. He had me watch a documentary titled "Girls Who Code". By this time I was truly fascinated with the idea of software development. I always wanted to know how, someone like me could make an application or a video game. This dream got halted by the time highschool came around. I did not have time to try and learn another language, I was attending around ten to eleven classes (around 2 or 3 of those were AP classes). I made it my personal goal to graduate highschool early. Fortunately, in my sophmore year I was able to attend a programming class. In this class I learned how to program using the language C++. My interest was sparked again. Making something like a game or an application, once again flooded my thoughts. I wanted to be good at programing and I really wanted to make something. In my Junior year of highschool, I was able to join the Jumpstart program. One of the cool things about this program is that I was able to fufill my GED requirements. I also was able to take ICS 111 at KCC. This class really allowed my to learn how to implement ideas using simple loop and classes. Taking this class really ignited that fire of desire more. I felt a little closer to my goal, my dream. 

Eventually, I was able to graduate school a year early. I quickly enrolled in UH manoa. I was ready, I wanted to finally achieve my dream of doing something bigger. In my freshmen year of college I was enrolled into ICS 211. I thought that this class would be easy enough given some of my past experiences with programming. However, as the class went on I began to get lost and feel lost. I did not understand why I was struggling. *"Am I good enough?"*. I was saddened. Was I not good enough for the dream I set out? Finally as the school year ended I was able to pass the class. Over the break I decided to try and re-ignite my interest in computer science. I wanted to find something I was passionate about. I found that I was passionate about Software engineering, A-I, and video games. I was able to refresh my view of my future. I wanted to continue to try hard no matter the dificulty. 

## My Future 

As the semesters went on I was able to improve my work ethic and problem solving skills. I was able to overcome many of the obstacles I felt in the first semester of college. Now a junior, I am closer than ever. I hope to develop a better understanding of some of the harder subjects in ICS such as Algorithims, and Data structures. In the future, I want to have more projects in my portfolio.
